- Mesonet pull retreives data over an hour old. May not be relevant.
- Create script that downloads historical MODIS and SCAN data to create series of figures
- Modify javascript for satellite to pull these images so the data does not have to be stored on the server. Files are extremely large.
- Create script that downloads current MODIS and SCAN data to create new figure that can be pulled.
